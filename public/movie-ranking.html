<h1>The Best Disney Movies according to Vicky</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>

<h2>Lilo & Stitch</h2>
<p>This movie is about a cute blue creature that lands on earth and learns how to be nice.<br />
I never get tired of this movie, I could watch it all day.</p>

<h2>101 Dalmatians</h2>
<p>I think that apart form having 101 dalmatians, Cruella DeVil it's an amazing character.<br />
The way all the dogs fight together to defeat her is very funny and entretaining.</p>

<h2>The Princess Diaries</h2>
<p>This movie is all about the 90s and I'm here for it! Cringy at times.<br />
But very lovely movie overall.</p>
